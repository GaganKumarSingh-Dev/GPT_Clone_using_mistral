# GPT Clone using Mistral

This project is all about having a chatbot right on your own computer! We've got Mistral, a super-smart language model, running locally, so you can have conversations anytime, anywhere, without needing the internet. It's like having your own personal chat companion, just for you. You type in something, Mistral thinks about it, and bam! You've got a response. It's like magic, but with words. So go ahead, chat away and see what fun conversations you can have!

## Installation

### 1. Create Virtual Environment

First, create a virtual environment using Python's `venv` module to isolate the project dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv env
```

### 2. Clone Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GaganKumarSingh-Dev/GPT_Clone_using_mistral.git
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
cd GPT_Clone_using_mistral
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Initialize Mistral

To use Mistral for generating text, you need to install and configure Ollama, the platform that hosts the Mistral model:

```bash
pip install ollama
ollama pull mistral
```

This will download and configure the Mistral model for use in your project.

## Usage

After completing the installation steps, you can run the `app.py` file to start the conversational interface:

```bash
python app.py
```

Once the application is running, navigate to the provided URL (typically `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) in your web browser. You can then enter prompts in the provided textbox and receive responses generated by Mistral.
